### Description

The first plot displays the population total of counties in Liberia. Based on the data above, the counties seem to have a consistent number in the hundred thousand range. However, Montserrado county is a large outlier to this data by having a total population greater than one million.

### Description

The plot above assesses the difference in data recordings based on two different data sets: source and remote data. The most visually evident difference in the two recordings is shown in the Montserrado county. In this county, the remote data is greater than the source data. 



### Plot #3

### Description

The plot above displays the difference in female population percentages between source and remote data. Therefore, this assesses the accuracy in the two data sets in their recording of female population. The biggest discrepancies are present in Gbapolu and Sinoe county. 



### Plot #4
