# Introduction
Hi! My name is Matthew Villca-Rocha and I am an freshman at the College of William & Mary planning on majoring in Finance. I am originally from Northern Virginia and have graduated from John Champe High School in Aldie, VA. This is my GitHub page where I will be storing all my in-class assignments for this fall semester's Data-100 Wicked Problems course taught by Professor Frazier.
