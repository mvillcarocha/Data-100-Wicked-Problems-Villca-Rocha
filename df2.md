# Utilizing Data Fusion to Assess the Changes in Europe's Population Density

Population density data is an integral aspect in legislating policies, disaster risk management, and planning infrastructure for a city. Throughout the 19th century, advancements in the recording of this data has evolved from censuses to the development of data science. From a macro-perspective, we have certainly improved in this manner, but there are still lapses that this data fails to reflect. These problems can range from students living on campus for a semester, suburban citizens working in urban cities, and incoming tourists throughout the seasons. To help mitigate this problem, one group of European data scientists decided to use a "multi-layered dasymetric approach" that combines statistics form geospatial data and a European Union-wide dataset that contains population grids to assess these populations intraday and monthly. 

 

To help display this approach, the group decided to use 3-D bar plots, scaled to 1km-squared, to display Milan, Italy. The height and transparency of the bars are proportional to the estimated population density of that population grid.  In response to the concern of population during daytime and nighttime, they provided two graphs and displayed the higher concentration in Milan during the day and a higher variability during the night.
