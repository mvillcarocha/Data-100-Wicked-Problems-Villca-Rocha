# Utilizing Data Fusion to Assess the Changes in Europe's Population Density

Population density data is an integral aspect in legislating policies, disaster risk management, and planning infrastructure for a city. Throughout the 19th century, advancements in the recording of this data has evolved from censuses to the development of data science. From a macro-perspective, we have certainly improved in this manner, but there are still lapses that this data fails to reflect. These problems can range from students living on campus for a semester, suburban citizens working in urban cities, and incoming tourists throughout the seasons. To help mitigate this problem, one group of European data scientists decided to use a "multi-layered dasymetric approach" that combines statistics form geospatial data and a European Union-wide dataset that contains population grids to assess these populations intraday and monthly. 



To help display this approach, the group decided to use 3-D bar plots, scaled to 1km-squared,
