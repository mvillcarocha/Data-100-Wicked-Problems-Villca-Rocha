# Data Reflection 5: Data Science

The emergence of data science has been an immense game changer in the way humans are able to analyze human behavior in many different aspects. Although data recording already existed through censuses, the application of this data had to be executed manually and proved to be very tedious. The introduction of data science introduced  the automation of calculating data to help humans understand adaptive, economic, and social systems. Through spatial intelligence, humans are able to understand the topography, income, and GDP density based on a certain area. However, as data becomes more and more valuable, does the utilization of private data violate our human rights? 

As Aran once stated, data science allows us to measure the numerous pieces of data we possess. Throughout our Data Science course, we were able to use spatial intelligence to plot many different factors of a county like the population density, topography, and night lights. Each one of these factors can be used to draw conclusions on how a population behaves. For example, for my project I used Panama and found that majority of the population comes from a subdivision called Panama City. I found that the population density and night lights were very high, relative to the other subdivisions here, and remembered that this is in fact the urban capital of the country. However, anyone that did not have that knowledge could still reach the same conclusion based on the conclusions I had drawn. The ability to draw conclusions based on simple data emphasizes the power that data science possesses in analyzing human processes. 

Despite the overwhelming positives that come with data science, the question becomes: How valuable can data be? Unfortunately, the emergence of technology has created a new market in profiting from the recording of our private data. Every app, website, or video watched is being recorded and sold to be used for data purposes. Although web browsers promote it as a way to enhance your experience, the reality is that personal data is being handled by people you are not aware of. Data science possesses the power to analyze and predict human processes with your data, but at what cost? 

To combat this problem that humans are facing, I believe regulations must be imposed to restrict the power of selling private data. By giving the government more power in handling our data, the less open access the private companies have. It proves to be a growing problem as technological companies are being sued or sent to court in violation of data rights. In the coming future, the government will play a growing role in this problem to help combat this problem. Nonetheless, data science possesses so many potentials that continues to surprise humans today. As more data is introduced, humans will be able to understand and predict the worlds biggest problems that was once not thought capable of.
